What does this code do?
- It triggers a function (meant for opening a door but really anything) when a player sits down and presses the bound keybind (f)




In all, you will need:

  - The client script (included)
  - The server script (included)
  - A remote event
  - A seat


I recommend placing the server script and remote event underneath the seat
The client script should go into StarterCharacterScripts.


Good luck!
