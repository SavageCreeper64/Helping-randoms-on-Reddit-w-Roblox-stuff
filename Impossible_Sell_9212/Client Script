		1. The first input is the action name. It is important that the name is unique and remains the same across the BindAction and UnbindAction
		2. The second input is the function to bind. This function is triggered when the bound key is pressed.
		3. The third input is whether or not you want to create a mobile button automatically. I wouldn't really worry about it.
		4. The fourth input is whatever button you want to bind. Keep in mind you can have multiple keys.
